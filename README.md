## About

Have you ever wanted to visit the website from *IT Crowd*'s S06E01 episode? Well, now you can at http://ladyproblems.co.uk/.

## Disclaimer

I'm aware that the original domain, shown in the series, is http://ladyproblems.com. 

However, as I'm writing this, that domain is for sale for an astonishing quantity of *â‚¬7,104.23*.

So, unless enough money is raised to change the domain, I opted for using `co.uk`, which, debatably, makes more sense, since the series is based in United Kingdom.
